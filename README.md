# Candy Crush Mini

This is a very simple game which is made from the idea of the game "Candy Crush". In this game, we are only matching straight lines of 3,4 or 5 in rows or columns. In this case, we are removing the matched candies and the ones above those spots are coming down to fill in those positions. And we are generating some more candies to fill up the rest of the positions.
